Hi everyone! ðŸ‘‹ I'm writing to you from the Seattle airport as we eagerly wait to board our flight to Seoul! Sitting here in the lounge, a place I've been countless times before, I'm still in disbelief that this moment has finally arrived. We've spent so much time in various stages of waiting during this process, trying to keep our excitement in check to avoid disappointment if something went wrong or the timeline got extended. But now, as I let myself fully soak it all in, it feels almost surreal.

With a little time before we head to Korea, I thought I'd share some insights into the matching process for South Korea adoptions and our specific journey to getting matched. One thing we've learned throughout this process is that every adoption is different. Whether it's the country you're adopting from, the agency you work with, the child you're adopting, or even the parents themselvesâ€”many factors influence how the process unfolds. One of the "selling points" for Korea is that they have had a well-established international adoption program for quite some time. Many of the steps are well-defined, and you can generally know what to expect along the way. At least, that's what people have told us since we haven't experienced adopting from anywhere else yet ðŸ˜….
<br/>
Here's how it works at a high level for Korea: You start by filling out a ton of paperwork, gathering necessary documents like financial statements and insurance, undergoing a health check, psych evaluation, and fingerprinting, obtaining references, filling out a detailed questionnaire about your personal life (covering everything from your childhood to how you and your spouse handle conflict), and taking several adoption classes and courses. Once we completed all of that and submitted everything to our agency, we had an in-person meeting with our social worker. She met us, visited our home, and asked us many personal questions about our past, present, and how we envision our future with our adopted child. After all that, our social worker compiled all the information and created what's called a Home Studyâ€”a comprehensive document that details Tommy's and my life and demonstrates our capability to raise and add another child to our family.
<br/>
This stage of the process probably took the longest. We began in the summer of 2022, ticking off one thing at a time, but it sure added up. I think we eventually got everything done and submitted around January 2023, though I'd have to check my email to confirm the exact date. At this point, the agency sends our completed and "approved" Home Study to the government of Korea. Once that happens, we enter our first big waiting period. Essentially, our Home Study packet is placed in a queue, and we wait for the South Korean government to match us with one of their available children. The timeline for this can vary since it's not a straightforward process where the first Home Study in line gets matched right away. How the government actually conducts the matching process is unclear. For example, we know that some Home Study-approved families from 2021 and 2022 are still waiting for a match.
<br/>
This is where our matching experience deviates a bit from the standard process because we didn't wait for a match. In South Korea, a child usually becomes available for international adoption around age one. These children are often placed for adoption at birth, then go to a foster home with the option for another relative to take them or for someone within the country to adopt. If neither of those options works out, the child is placed in the pool for international adoption and matched with a waiting family. Occasionally, a family that has been matched with a child may pass on them, often due to health-related concerns. These children are then placed on a "waiting child" list, where adoptive families interested in them can request more information and inquire about adopting.
<br/>
In the spring of 2023, we received an email about a little girl on this list who needed a family. Tommy and I hadn't necessarily considered this route, but when we got the email about this little girl needing a forever family, it was too hard to pass up. After reviewing her initial documentation, we submitted our interest in adopting her. We were then sent additional paperwork to completeâ€”another lengthy questionnaire asking us to clarify our understanding of her health conditions and explain why we felt capable of caring for her. Many of the questions felt repetitive from our Home Study, and we weren't entirely sure what the purpose of this document was. After submitting it, we learned that another family was also interested in adopting her, so the agency formed a committee to review both families' questionnaires and choose which family was best suited for this adoption. Unfortunately, we weren't chosen.
<br/>
At the time, it was frustrating and a bit disappointing. We had seen pictures and videos and started imagining what our life would be like with this little girl as part of our family. We hadn't realized that the questionnaire we submitted would be scrutinized so deeply and used as the main deciding factor. Despite our disappointment, we took it as a learning opportunity and figured she wasn't meant to be ours. So, back to waiting...
<br/>
Fast forward to November 2023, and another email comes throughâ€”this time with two little boys on the waiting child list. We immediately jumped on it and requested their information for a closer look. Both boys were similar in age and absolutely adorable. When the agency sends out details about these children on the waiting list, they give them English names for reference. These two boys were named "Deacon" and "Gus." I'm not sure why, but it didn't take me long to choose "Gus." Something about his little smile and story just captured my heart. We submitted our interest in adopting him and, once again, received a questionnaire to fill out. This time, we were determined to craft a compelling story and ensure we'd get matched. However, as we began reviewing the documents about Gus and filling out the questionnaire, more information about potential health concerns emerged. I'm not sure how much I can share publicly at this point, so I'll hold off on the details for now. Essentially, he had been matched with a family who went as far as traveling to Korea to meet him, but after expressing concerns about his health, they backed out of the adoption.
<br/>
The agency strongly recommended that we consult with a pediatric doctor specializing in adoption to review all the medical information we had received and give us their assessment of Gus's condition. Of course, this would be an additional costâ€”not a small one, either. We decided to review all the medical information ourselves first and see how we felt before moving forward with a doctor's review.
<br/>
When we first started this process, one of the forms we had to fill out was about which health conditions we were comfortable with in our adopted child. It was a strange form to complete because most of the conditions listed were things Tommy and I didn't know much about, and we weren't sure if we'd be able to support a child with one of them. We also knew that if we were having a biological child, we'd love them no matter what health conditions they might encounter, so it felt strange to have to specify what we wouldn't be "comfortable" with in this scenario. Ultimately, we kept it relatively basic, marking most things as okay and not getting too specific. But now, as we considered committing to a child who might have a serious health concern, we had to really think through and pray about what we felt we could handle.
<br/>
It would be easier to explain how we came to our decision if I could share the exact health concern we were dealing with. But for now, what I can say is that there was a possibility Gus could have a condition that would significantly limit his mobility and potentially involve intellectual disabilities. There was also a chance that he could grow up to be perfectly healthy without any of these issues. At not quite a year old, the concerns were hard to diagnose definitively.
<br/>
After many conversations, lots of prayer, and thorough research, Tommy and I sat down one night in our hotel in Toronto, Canada, and had a deep discussion about where we stood. We talked about how the whole reason we wanted to adopt was to provide a loving home to a child who didn't have one. That was certainly the case hereâ€”not only had Gus's original parents decided he was too much, but a second set of parents had reached the same conclusion. We also discussed the "worst-case scenarios" and whether we felt equipped to handle them. Of course, we didn't feel readyâ€”who does? But we were confident that we could prepare ourselves if needed and that God had equipped us to this point and would continue to do so in the future. So, it was a yesâ€”we were moving forward with "Gus." ðŸ¤—
<br/>
Now came the questionnaire. There was no way I was going to rush through the answers this time. I took my time and wrote detailed responses to each question, citing Tommy's and my past experience with foster kids and youth. We added our research on the possible health conditions and made it clear that we were prepared for anything that came our way. We also met with a specialized doctor who reviewed the medical information and provided insights that made us realize the original family who raised the concerns had likely overreacted, and there was a good chance Gus would have no significant health issues. The South Korean government is very careful and diligent (rightfully so) about ensuring that prospective adoptive parents fully understand the child's health before adopting. This is a good thing, but it often leads to more tests and scrutiny than a typical baby would undergoâ€”this was definitely the case for Gus. We included all the information we received from the doctor in our documentation and eventually submitted it to our agency. Once again, another family was interested in adopting Gus, so the decision would go to a committee, and we would have to wait.
<br/>
This time, I tried to keep my expectations in check, but it was difficult given how much we had already invested emotionally and practically into this child. We had spent so much time considering the health risks and carefully crafting our responses on the form that it was impossible not to feel a sense of anticipation. We waited anxiously for the committee to meet and for our social worker to update us on their decision.
<br/>
We were back home in Missouri for Christmas when we got a text message from our social worker asking if it was a good time to talk. Tommy was in a meeting, and I was a bundle of nerves, running through all the possibilities in my mind. Does a call mean bad news or good news? Last time it was just an email, so maybe this is a positive sign? Or could it mean more paperwork? All these thoughts raced through my head as I waited. Finally, Tommy finished his meeting, and we called our social worker together.
<br/>
And then, we got the news we had been hoping for: It was a match! We were going to be parents! More paperwork and waiting was to come but we now had a little boy who we knew all the work and waiting was for!
