Hi all! I wanted to share a quick update on our timeline and reflect a bit on how we've been feeling after the big week when we finally got to meet our son.

Once our court hearing was behind us, the waiting game began again. We're now in a phase where we need to wait for the Korean government to notify us of provisional approval and let us know when the official adoption decree will be issued. Once we get that date, we'll be able to schedule our appointment at the U.S. Embassy for our son's visa interview. He'll leave South Korea with his passport and a U.S. visa, granting him citizenship when we arrive in the U.S. Once those dates are set, we can book our flight home, but the visa interview needs to happen at least two days before we depart.

When you adopt from South Korea, you're given two options: either make two trips—one to meet your child and attend the court hearing, and a second to take custody and finalize the visa—or make one long trip and wait it out in Korea. When we got our court date, we decided to go with the longer trip. We weighed the pros and cons: it would be cheaper without an extra set of flights, we could stay in a long-term Airbnb rather than a hotel, and we could explore Asia while visiting Tommy's family in Hong Kong. Plus, our jobs allowed us to work remotely, and the most important reason was being able to visit our son during the waiting period. The only downside was that Angela had just started a new school year, so she couldn't join us for the entire trip. Thankfully, we have wonderful friends and family who stepped up to care for her.

After our mini vacation in Japan, we settled into this next phase of waiting. We knew things would feel different this week because Tommy and I had to get back to work. Figuring out how to work remotely while adjusting to the time zone difference wasn't easy—9 a.m. in California is 1 a.m. in Seoul. And life here operates late; for example, our jiu-jitsu class is from 9:30 to 11 p.m., which made it hard to sleep before work. We initially tried staying up all night, working, and then sleeping after. Our plan was to get up in the afternoon, do our day-to-day things, take a nap before going to the gym, and then start the cycle again. It wasn't a bad idea, but we quickly found out it might not work as it completely threw off our internal clocks. Planning to try starting work later this coming week to see if that helps.

On top of work, we had been eagerly awaiting our visit with our son on Wednesday. We were really looking forward to it, but Monday brought disappointing news. Over the weekend, he had come down with hand, foot, and mouth disease, and we wouldn't be able to see him that week. It was a huge letdown—not only because we couldn't visit, but also because it hurt knowing he was sick, and we couldn't be there to comfort him. Adding to that, the following week was Chuseok, a Korean holiday, which meant the adoption agency would be closed. Meaning, we wouldn't get see our son until at least the week after.

With everything happening—missing our son, returning to work, feeling out of sync with our sleep, and being far from Angela—I was starting to feel a bit down. I started questioning if taking this long trip was the right choice after all. I shared my feelings with Tommy, and as always, he graciously reminded me to stay grounded and continue what we've been doing for the last two and a half years: make the most of the waiting, and trust God's timing. That's what we've been trying to do, enjoying our time together.

Thursday night, after coming back from jiu-jitsu, just as we were getting ready to rest before another workday, we got the best surprise! We checked our email and saw that the Korean government had issued our provisional approval—and set a date for when the adoption decree would be finalized! We suddenly had a date for taking custody of our son, and we could now start planning our trip back home. It all happened much faster than we expected, since the agency had told us we likely wouldn't hear anything until after the holiday.

So here we are: on September 30th, we will take our son home as our own! Then, the following Wednesday, we'll have his visa appointment, and we plan to head home on Friday. It's all coming together so quickly, and we're incredibly excited! Tommy and I want to express our deepest gratitude to everyone who's been following our journey and praying for us. We really do feel all your love and support.

We now have a week in Hong Kong to spend time with family, and then we'll return to Korea for our final two weeks before getting to bring our son home! Please continue to keep us in your prayers as we move into this transition phase. Pray that our next few visits with our son go smoothly and help ease the transition, pray for the foster family as they prepare to say goodbye, and pray for Tommy, Angela, and I as we prepare to welcome the newest member of our family!
