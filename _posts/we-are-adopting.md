As many of you probably already know, weâ€™ve been in the process of adopting for over two years now. After years of paperwork and waiting, weâ€™ve finally received a court date and will be heading to South Korea at the end of this month to meet and bring home our son! Itâ€™s been a long journey to get here, but weâ€™re beyond excited and grateful to be where we are today.

In truth, our parenting journey began over four years ago. Before I explain our adoption journey I feel like it only makes sense to explain how we got here and what led to this moment first.

Back in the summer of 2015, Tommy and I were fresh into a relationship that had quickly evolved from the friendship we had shared for the previous four years into something more. We found ourselves living thousands of miles apart, each in our parentsâ€™ homes, and communicating exclusively via phone. During one of our long FaceTime calls, we started talking about what we both wanted in terms of a future family. I had known for a while that if God ever gave me the opportunity, I wanted to adopt or foster kids, but I had no idea if that was something Tommy would also be interested in. To my surprise, he began explaining his dreams of taking in children who needed a loving family and how he envisioned growing his family through adoption. As our relationship continued to grow and progress through dating, engagement, and marriage, God continued to place on our hearts the desire to adopt and foster children.

Fast forward to January 2020: we had settled into marriage, our jobs, and life in the Bay Area. We were beginning to feel that it was the right time to open our home to children. Our apartment at the time had a spare bedroom that we werenâ€™t using, and we felt financially ready to support a child. In February, our church hosted an information session led by a local non-profit that supports foster families. We attended and knew it was time to seriously begin taking steps toward fostering. Little did we know what would happen in the world over the next few monthsâ€¦

Ultimately, the pandemic provided the perfect opportunity to complete all the paperwork and training needed to become certified foster parents. We eventually welcomed our first foster daughter in March of 2021.

Our experience with fostering was full of ups and downs. We built strong relationships with the various children who came into our home, but we struggled with the emotional toll of connecting with children, getting them into a good routine, only to have them removed and placed back into difficult situations. While we were in between placements in December 2021, circumstances led to our niece, Angela, needing to move from Arizona to California to live with us. Just like everything else leading up to this point, we knew Godâ€™s timing was perfect.

As we settled into life with Angela living with us, we eventually reopened our home for new foster placements. However, after a few months, only respite care options came through. Tommy and I spent some time praying and reflecting on what we felt was next for our family. We were ready to be parents and have a child in our home permanently. We didnâ€™t know how long Angela would be with us, but either way, we felt it would be good for her to experience having another child around. We started researching adoption agencies and options, as well as considering having a biological child or looking into more long-term foster care options. Ultimately, we felt that adoption, particularly international adoption, was the right path for us. After more research, we found an agency, Holt International, a faith-based organization that facilitates adoptions from various countries, including Hong Kong. We were open to adopting from anywhere and thought it would be wonderful to adopt from Hong Kong if possible.

Shortly after submitting our initial application, we received a call from Holt. They were eager to process our application and felt we would be a great fit for the South Korea program. Due to the nature of the South Korea program, they open a limited number of slots each year for families to enter, and there was one slot left. If we could submit our initial paperwork quickly, we could secure our place. That marked the beginning of a whole lot of paperwork and prayers, which have ultimately led us to where we are nowâ€”preparing to travel to South Korea to pick up our son!

We arenâ€™t able to share too many details about him right now, so Iâ€™ll hold off on that until heâ€™s officially ours and I can provide a proper introduction. Throughout this process, there have been many ups and downs that Iâ€™d love to share more about, especially for anyone out there considering adoption in the future. Weâ€™re still at the beginning of this journey and have the actual parenting work ahead of us, but I feel like God has shown and taught us a lot up to this point that I want to shareâ€”not only for others to learn but also for myself to look back on in the future and see how far God has brought us. But Iâ€™ll save that for another post. For now, Iâ€™ll leave you with some details about our upcoming trip and whatâ€™s next for us!

So, when do we get to bring our son home? Well, we still donâ€™t know for sure. We have a court date in South Korea, so Tommy and I will be traveling to Seoul in a few weeks. Weâ€™ll get to meet our son and his foster family, as well as attend our court hearing. After that, Tommy and I will stay in Seoul as we wait for the paperwork to finalize and for an appointment at the U.S. Embassy for our visa application, which will allow us to bring our son home. Depending on various circumstances, this waiting process can take anywhere from 4-6 weeks. While weâ€™re waiting, Tommy and I will be working remotely in South Korea, meeting with our son and his foster family, and soaking in as much of Korea as we can. Weâ€™re expecting to bring him home sometime in October. Please keep praying for us as we travel and continue to wait on more court and government processes as we fill out more paperwork and wait. Pray that we would use this time wisely making the most out of the time Tommy and I will have together and our moments with our son before bringing him back to the U.S. We are so grateful for all of you and all the love and support you have all shown us over the years. Thereâ€™s no way we would have been able to get where we are today without the community that has been behind us and weâ€™ll need you even more as our family continues to grow.

If youâ€™re interested in continuing to follow along on our journey subscribe to my email updates at the bottom of this page. Iâ€™ll try to write some more posts to keep you all updated and some to share more insight in the process leading up to now. Thanks again and more to come soon ðŸ™‚
