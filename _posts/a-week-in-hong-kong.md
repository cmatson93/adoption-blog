Hi all! I wanted to give one final quick update before next week when our son officially becomes ours, and I can introduce him to you properly!
<br/>
Throughout this journey, people have often asked how I'm feeling or if I'm excited. My usual response has been that I'm trying to keep my expectations low and that I'll feel more excitement once the next step is done. Well, it's official: I've reached the point where all I feel is excitement! ðŸ˜…
<br/>
We just returned to South Korea after spending a week in Hong Kong, and we're feeling eager to wrap things up here and head back to the U.S. to reunite as a family of five (Leia included ðŸ˜‰). It's crazy how fast this past month has flown by, and I know the final few weeks will go just as quickly.
<br/>
Some highlights from our trip to Hong Kong include seeing family, enjoying a relaxing stay at one of Tommy and I's favorite hotels, a wonderful dinner out, and lots of reminiscing as we revisited some of our favorite spots from when we lived there. It's always a joy to return to Hong Kong. We're forever grateful for the time we spent living there togetherâ€”it was such a fun chapter in our lives. Back then, we didn't have much in terms of money or material things, but we spent all our time enjoying each other's company. Hopefully, one day we'll be able to spend extended periods back in Hong Kong so our kids can grow to love the city as much as we do.
<br/>
We spent most of our time in Hong Kong hanging out with family. It was the Mid-Autumn Festival while we were there, so on our first night, we met up with family and enjoyed a meal together. Normally, we'd go out to admire the moon afterward, but a rainstorm rolled in that evening, so we didn't get the chance. Fortunately, the next night, the weather cleared up, and we had a Hong Kong-style barbecue and enjoyed some night swimming with the family.

Our flight back to South Korea was at 2 AM on Monday morning, so we spent most of Sunday with family before heading to the airport for our red-eye flight to Seoul. We got back to our Airbnb on Monday morning just in time to catch the Chiefs game (I'm definitely ready to watch football at normal hours again once we're back in the U.S.!). Later that afternoon, we went to the adoption agency to visit our son. We got to spend a few hours with him, and it was heartwarming to see that he still remembered us. Once again, he didn't want us to leave when the time came. We have one more visit this Friday before taking custody next week! We're incredibly grateful for these extra visits, as they'll hopefully ease the transition for him. But I know for Tommy and I, we're just ready to bring him home! It's hard to leave and go back to our Airbnb without him, so we're relieved that we only have to do it one more time!
<br/>
This week, aside from our visits, we're finishing up work before taking parental leave. I'll have about five months off, and I'm really looking forward to that time. I'm also trying to finish my tasks at work strong before the break. Another thing on our to-do list is shopping for a few final baby-related items, so we're fully prepared for our week in Korea with him before flying home next Friday. So far, we haven't been able to find any baby food at the local grocery stores, so we're planning to check out some larger stores to stock up on baby food and snacks for the week and the flight home.
<br/>
We'll also spend our final weekend here catching up with some of our college friends. We're having dinner on Friday night with some who are currently living in Seoul and will visit another friend outside the city on Saturday. It should be the perfect end to our time in South Korea before officially welcoming our son and heading home!
<br/>
Tommy and I are so excited and can't wait to officially introduce him to all of you and share some pictures! Stay tuned!
<br/>
