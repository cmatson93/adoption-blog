Week one in South Korea is officially in the books!
<br/>
Sorry for the delay in this update, but we've been quite busy adjusting to life here in Seoul. After our court hearing at the end of the week, we spent the last few days of our PTO with a quick trip to Japan! Now that we're back, I finally have time to sit down, reflect, and share our experience.
<br/>
Overall, our first week in South Korea went as smoothly as we could have hoped. We arrived in Seoul late Friday afternoon, and since our first meeting at the agency wasn't until Monday, we had the weekend to settle into our Airbnb, get familiar with the area, and even find a nearby jiu-jitsu gym to train at. Our Airbnb is in a quiet residential neighborhood, which has been a fun experience. There aren't many foreigners around, so it feels very local, yet we're still just a short subway or bus ride away from the more central tourist spots in Seoul.
<br/>
On Monday afternoon, we had our first meeting at the adoption agency, where we finally got to meet our son and his foster family. Tommy and I tried our best to go in with minimal expectations, focusing only on our excitement to finally meet him. We brought a stuffed animal Angela had picked out as a gift for him, along with a few toys, just in case he felt shy. When we arrived at the agency, they brought us into a small room to fill out some paperwork. We also met another family adopting their second child from Korea, which was nice as it gave us a chance to chat about their past experience and share our current journey with them.
<br/>
Then, it was time to meet our son!
<br/>
It's hard to describe the emotions we felt in that moment. After months of looking at videos and pictures, there he was, right in front of us, ready to play. "Surreal" doesn't even begin to capture itâ€”we were absolutely overjoyed.
<br/>
We spent time together in one of the playrooms at the agency. It was Tommy and I, our son, his foster family, and a translator to help facilitate communication. Right from the start, our little guy was excited to see us and eager to play. Tommy gave him the stuffed animal early on, and we quickly confirmed our suspicion that he loves stuffed animalsâ€”he lit up with laughter and was immediately engaged. There was a Little Tikes car in the room, and Tommy pushed him around in it for a while, which he loved.
<br/>
One of my biggest concerns going into this week was how the meeting with the foster family would go. We had received mixed signals during our preparation about others experiences with foster families, leaving me unsure of how they might feel about us or if they'd be emotional or protective during this transition. But once again, God answered our prayers and the interaction went incredibly well! As we played with our son, we also had a chance to talk with the foster family. It was a great opportunity for us to ask questions about our son and for them to get to know us better. There were some tears shed, but they were happy tears, as we all felt the joy of this special little boy that we've all come to love.
<br/>
We also exchanged gifts with the foster family. They were so kind, gifting us several sentimental items, including our son's hanbok (the traditional outfit he wore for his first birthday) and photo albums filled with pictures from his life so far. The first meeting couldn't have gone better, and we felt so grateful.
<br/>
For our second meeting, things were a bit more relaxed since we had already met and didn't need to sign any more paperwork. We spent almost two hours in the playroom with our son. He had just woken up from a nap and was still a little sleepy, so it took him a bit longer to warm up to us. But once he did, we had such a wonderful time playing with him. After our first meeting, the foster family mentioned how surprised they were by how quickly he got comfortable with us, since he normally takes a long time to warm up to people outside his foster family. While he was naturally still running to his foster family at first, by the second meeting, after about an hour of playing, he ran right into Tommy's arms. It's a moment that I will treasure. ðŸ’œ
<br/>
After some time, the small room we were in started to feel a bit boring, so Tommy and I picked him up and carried him around the halls, showing him the pictures and saying hi to some of the other foster kids. Getting to spend a bit of alone time with him where he was in our arms was so special and felt like it really helped us build a bond with him. When it was time to go, he didn't want to leave. We had to help him put his shoes on and carry him outâ€”it felt good knowing we weren't the only ones not ready to say goodbye.
<br/>
We are beyond grateful for two amazing first visits and feel incredibly blessed to have the chance to stay in Seoul while we wait for things to be finalized so we can visit him more. Special shout out and thanks to all of you who are helping with Angela while we're gone, so grateful for you all!

Our final big step for the week was our court hearing. We had to be at the adoption agency in the morning, and from there, we rode with the other families who had hearings that day to the courthouse. Two agency staff members accompanied usâ€”a coordinator and a translator. When we got to court, we waited outside until the judge called us in. This was Tommy and I's first time in a courtroom, and we were definitely nervous. It's funny how after all the questions, paperwork, and meetings with social workers over the past few years, you'd think we'd be used to this kind of thing by now, but this moment felt especially significant.
<br/>
We were second in line, and the family in front of us went first. We had been told the judge would ask us a few questions, and we were given a list of possible questions to prepare for. In the end, the judge's questions were pretty straightforward, and the whole process took no more than seven minutes. Everything went smoothly, and we headed home right afterward, as we had a flight to Japan to catch!
<br/>
Spending the last few days of our PTO in Japan was the perfect idea. We got to explore a part of Japan we'd never visited before and reunite with a good friend from college whom we hadn't seen since our last trip to Korea eight years ago. After a few days with our friend, Tommy and I wrapped up the trip with a relaxing stay in Beppu, Japan, known for its hot springs. It was great to unwind and enjoy some time together, knowing that these kinds of trips will become fewer once we're home with our sonâ€”and we're perfectly fine with that!

Now, we're back in Seoul, trying to figure out a new routine that includes enough sleep, working US hours, hitting the gym, and, of course, spending more time with our son. More updates on all of that coming soon!
